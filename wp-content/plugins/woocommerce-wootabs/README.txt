== Description ==

If you are one of those people that are ALWAYS looking for more ways to keep your WooCommerce website visitors longer then WooTabs is the perfect plugin for you.
Simple to use but also powerful when it comes to decreasing bounce rates and increasing sales, the plugin allows you to add extra tabs (as many as you want) to the WooCommerce Product Details page.
Save your time and your customer’s time by implementing the WooWaitlist plugin. Be directly notified by email immediately when your favorite product is back in stock. 

	* You can add unlimited tabs; the limit is only set by your theme width
	* You can set a global tab that can be applied to all products
	* Easy tab content handling
	* Native WordPress WYSIWYG editor for editing custom content
	* You can edit the title of the tabs
	* You can delete tabs
	* Tabs can be reordered by using the drag and drop feature
	* You can insert text in the Tab description area along with shortcodes (for example, contact shortcode)
	* You can disable Tabs that you don't want to use but don’t want deleted, just in case they are needed in the future
	* Instant Save for WooTab settings using Ajax
	* Includes .mo and .po files for localization
	* You can enable or disable access to Shop Manager via Global Settings
	* You can choose if you want to Keep WooCommerce Data or Uninstall
	* Tabs in WooCommerce were introduced from version 2.0.x, so WooTabs is compatible for the same versions
